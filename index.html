<!-- SCRAPPED - Is kinda irrelavant and demotes many SDG goals...

 Another big problem is light pollution. If you look out of your window, it’s likely you will only see a few stars – if not, none.
For the select few who see stars, you’re lucky to not have a light polluted town or city. 
The reason for this phenomenon is light pollution. When there is a lot of light in an area, you can see well around you, but not above you!
This is a problem because many fascinated astronomers don’t have equipment to make discoveries up above. 
You can fix this – just don’t use lights as often! Good for money, good for astronomers.

The paragraph technically contributes to SDG 4 though! Check it out here: https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4 -->

        <div class="incooo content">Now, not only does this affect both SDG 12 – Responsible consumption and production (because of over-consumption and wastage) AND SDG 2 – Zero hunger (because of food wastage and putting forward an active problem to the SDG) but also SDG 13 – Climate change. This is because as mentioned before, most of this is because of fruits and vegetables, which help balance CO₂ levels in the atmosphere and ultimately – climate change.</div>

            Solving this problem contributes to 3 SDGs, so how do we fix this? There are two main ways, promote food conservation – which you might not be able to do – and conserve food – which you probably can do. So, next time you eat, maybe consider putting a bit less on your plate (literally).

        <div id="heading3">Sustainable electricity creation and usage.</div>

        <div class="content3">Electricity is known for being a useful source of energy, but there are a few big problems with it. The biggest one is how it is made. Most of the time, you heat water to make water vapour (steam) is used to power the turbine which then powers the generator. If you don’t see the problem, it’s heating the water. We can’t electrically heat it as perpetual energy doesn’t exist. So, we use fossil fuels, and making electricity this way becomes the second biggest reason for climate change. </div>
            <div class="content3">You see, fossil fuels are a type of non-renewable energy. <b>Non-renewable</b> energy sources (like fossil fuels) aren't sustainable for humans in the long term, and will eventually run out. <b>Renewable</b> energy sources are, while may it not be infinite, a sustainable and long-lasting fuel for our civilization.</div>
            <div class="content3">We can stop this problem by simply using sustainable methods to power turbines. Nuclear energy is the most sustainable type, but nuclear reactors can also cause the most destruction if not handled properly for a very long time. Wind turbines are also pretty sustainable, and don’t cause as much destruction if not handled properly (but still are dangerous, so don’t go near them!) This also contributes heavily to SDG 7 – Responsible consumption and production</div>

    <div id="heading4">Environmental footprint</div>
    <div class="content4">Poorer countries have one thing in common which can beat the better, richer high-income countries – and that is environmental footprint.</div>
    <div class="content4">Environmental footprint is the (negative) impact man has on the environment. According to the UN's official SDG website on SDG 12 (which you can find in the footer of this very website) – as of 2018, the material footprint per capita (person) is 24 tons for high-income countries and 2.5 tons for low-income countries. To reduce environmental footprint: stop polluting, conserve energy, and spread the message.</div>

        <div class="content2">As I said in the beginning, this SDG is linked to many others, which you can see came out to be true! Thanks for joining me in this journey! (I totally didn’t copy-paste some code from my other projects…)</div>
